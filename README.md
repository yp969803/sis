# sis
A distributable slack app made using Slack Bolt. It is a chat-bot which can handle messages and commands from slack and perform tasks. It is directed at organizations to use this as a utility bot to render tasks from slack itself using messages or slash commands. 

## Services
We use the following services in our app
* Redis: Used to logout and blacklist users. Serves as cache for contests API. Download from [here](https://redis.io/download)

## ENV
We use dotenv package to load our environment variables and thus a `.env` file with following variables nneds to be setup in the root directory:

    SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<secret key that slack uses to sign every request>
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<xoxb bot token to subscribe to events>
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN=<xapp app token for setup changes over all installations>
    REDIS_URL=<connection string of redis server>
    PORT=optional:<port to be used>

## Setup
Download the github repository or clone it.
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/NanoNish/sis.git
```
Now install redis services [redis](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) and start the redis server. To run the project locally use these env variables.
```
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```
Install all the package dependencies.
```
npm ci
```
Now you can run the app using the start script
```
npm run start
```

## Components
`src` folder is the source folder where all the magic happens
* `app.ts`          driver file of the project
* `router.ts`       message to function/script mapping
* `services`        all service related functions are kept here
